   // Target: Connect to NT and subscribe to ES data
   var nt = new NinjaTraderConnection();
   await nt.ConnectAsync(config);
   await nt.SubscribeMarketDataAsync("ES", DataType.Last);
   ```

3. **Test Order Execution**
   ```csharp
   // Target: Submit a market order in Sim101
   var order = new OrderRequest {
       Symbol = "ES",
       Action = OrderAction.Buy,
       Quantity = 1
   };
   await nt.SubmitOrderAsync(order);
   ```

4. **Verify Discord Notifications**
   ```python
   # Test all notification types
   python scripts/test_notifications.py
   ```

5. **Set Up Secrets Management**
   ```bash
   # Copy template and fill in secrets
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env  # Edit with your secrets
   
   # Check required secrets
   python scripts/manage_secrets.py --check
   
   # Sync to GitHub (when ready)
   python scripts/manage_secrets.py --sync-to-github --dry-run  # Preview first

## ⏸️ Continuous Improvement Workflow - PAUSED

> **Status:** `PAUSED` - Workflow disabled until prerequisites are met  
> **Last Updated:** 2026-02-16  
> **Action Required:** Complete all items below before re-enabling

### Why It's Paused
The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/continuous-improvement.yml`) is currently running with **mock/fake data** - it simulates improvement but doesn't actually analyze real trades or improve anything. The scheduled cron trigger has been disabled.

### Prerequisites to Re-enable

Before restarting the workflow, the following must be implemented:

#### 1. Database Infrastructure (🔴 Critical)
- [ ] Create PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB instance
- [ ] Run migration scripts from `docs/improvement-system/01-analytics-schema.md`
- [ ] Set up `DATABASE_URL` secret in GitHub repository settings
- [ ] Verify database connection from GitHub Actions

#### 2. Trade Data Collection (🔴 Critical)
- [ ] Implement `trade_outcomes` table logging (actual trade results)
- [ ] Log every executed trade with: entry/exit prices, P&L, commissions, slippage
- [ ] Ensure minimum 100+ historical trades before first analysis
- [ ] Set up `model_predictions` logging for accuracy tracking

#### 3. Real Data Queries (🔴 Critical)
- [ ] Replace mock methods in `optimization_runner.py`:
  - [ ] `_get_trade_stats()` - Query actual trade statistics from DB
  - [ ] `_get_strategy_performance()` - Query `strategy_performance` table
  - [ ] `_get_model_performance()` - Query `model_performance` table
  - [ ] `_get_regime_performance()` - Query market regime data
- [ ] Add proper database connection handling in `OptimizationRunner`

#### 4. Model Training Pipeline (🟠 High)
- [ ] Implement actual model retraining (not mock)
- [ ] Set up Optuna for hyperparameter optimization
- [ ] Create backtesting framework integration
- [ ] Store trained models with versioning

#### 5. A/B Testing Infrastructure (🟠 High)
- [ ] Implement real A/B test deployment (not simulation)
- [ ] Set up traffic splitting mechanism
- [ ] Create A/B test monitoring and metrics collection
- [ ] Implement automatic rollback on degradation

#### 6. Secrets & Configuration (🟡 Medium)
- [ ] Set `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` in GitHub secrets (for notifications)
- [ ] Configure production environment protection rules
- [ ] Set up environment-specific configuration

### Restart Instructions

Once all prerequisites are complete:

1. **Uncomment the schedule trigger** in `.github/workflows/continuous-improvement.yml`:
   ```yaml
   on:
     schedule:
       - cron: '0 * * * *'  # Run every hour
     workflow_dispatch:
   ```

2. **Verify with manual run first:**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run "Continuous Improvement"
   ```

3. **Monitor the first few runs** to ensure real data is being processed

4. **Update this TODO section** to mark as complete

### Current Workflow Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Workflow file | ✅ Functional | Runs successfully but with fake data |
| Scheduled runs | ⏸️ Disabled | Cron commented out |
| Manual trigger | ✅ Available | Can still run manually for testing |
| Database queries | ❌ Mock only | Returns hardcoded values |
| Trade logging | ❌ Not implemented | No real trade data captured |
| Model training | ❌ Mock only | No actual retraining occurs |
| A/B testing | ❌ Simulated only | No real deployment or traffic split |

## 📝 Notes

- Start with **ES (E-mini S&P 500)** only - most liquid
- Use **Sim101** (paper trading) until strategy is validated
- Keep risk VERY low initially (0.5% per trade)
- Document EVERYTHING in Discord for monitoring

**Priority Legend:**
- 🔴 Critical - Blocking other work
- 🟠 High - Core functionality
- 🟡 Medium - Important but not blocking
- 🟢 Low - Nice to have
